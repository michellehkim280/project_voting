    "## Summary\n",
    "This project looks to analyze voting patterns in Virginia from historical election data, aiming to uncover patterns and predict future outcomes. By looking into data on voting by candidate and party, with geographical information, we seek to explore voter preferences, election results and predict the outcomes of the 2024 election. In this project, we look to answer the question of how election results in Virginia have changed over time and how results will look in future elections. Our project utilizes numerous datasets and csv files, including county, county adjacencies, and voting in Virginia data. These datasets were cleaned before conducting analysis, which is discussed later in this paper. After cleaning, the variables within the data were analyzed through visualizations. The variables being used in this analysis include county FIP codes, total votes, candidates, and political party. These are key variables that will be the most effective in giving insights about voting in Virginia. With the help of these visualizations, our project then aims to predict the election results of Virginia in 2024. Our projected results show that the Democratic party votes will continue to be the highest, but that the Republican party will also have a substantial amount of votes."

    "## Data\n",
    "This part of the paper is dedicated to explaining the data and key variables of the analysis, including the data cleaning that was conducted in this project. Data cleaning is an essential first step in data analysis and helped to ensure that our datasets were consistent. Before cleaning, we imported necessary libraries and read in the csv files. Our datasets primarily consist of historical voting data for Virginia. Key variables include, ‘year,’ ‘county name’, ‘candidate’, ‘party’, ‘candidate votes’, and ‘total votes,’ which provide information about electoral trends over the years."

    "Reading the numerous county_data csv files was troubling because we had to conduct the same loading and cleaning for each, and figure out how to save it all to one dataframe. We used a for loop that iterates over our list of files and stores them all in one array. After loading in the multiple csv files, we cleaned them by first standardizing the FIPS codes. This ensures that any column named ‘FIPS’ or ‘county_fips’ contains a string that is 5 characters, giving us consistency across data sets. An always significant challenge with any project involving data is dealing with missing values and outliers that could potentially skew the analysis. For this dataset, we decided to fill in missing values with the median of the column. We went through this strategy to maintain the integrity of the dataset, rather than entirely removing it. Removing entire rows with missing values could result in losing potentially good data and reduce the power of our statistical analysis. Our approach was also similarly done with categorical columns, as we fill in missing values with the most of each column. However, we removed any rows that are missing the FIPS code because it is critical in identifying counties or states. Without the FIPS code, our geographical data would be incomplete."

    "## Results\n",
    "Before making any predictions, we wanted to first analyze historical data and gain an understanding of voting in Virginia. We began by creating bar graphs displaying the total candidate votes for presidential candidates in the United States from each election in 2000-2020. To create the graphs, we selected only relevant columns from the voting_va dataframe (vdf) and filtered the data frame for the election year, ensuring that the analysis only focuses on that one election cycle. The code then aggregates the total votes for each candidate using ‘groupby’ on the column, ‘candidate’ and then adding up ‘candiddatevotes.’ This gives us the total votes for each candidate that they received in the designated election from Virginia. We used specific colors for different parties, so red for the Republican Party, blue for the Democratic Party, etc. This was to give a visual distinction between candidates and to allow for better comprehension of the graph.  \n",

    "This is the first graph of our project where the Democratic Party recieved the most votes. The graph clearly demonstrates that the vast majority of votes were once again taken by the two major parties: Democrats and Republicans. Barack Obama (Democrat) and John McCain (Republican) received almost all of the votes, with Obama leading significantly in Virginia. Barack Obama’s lead over John McCain is visually significant. This might potentially reflect broader national trends or specific local factors that led more voters towards Obama."

    "This the last election for which we have data for, and plays a key role in the predicition of the 2024 election outcome for Virginia voters. The changes in parties is of the most notable. Although smaller in total votes than democrats and republicans, libertarian is an important category. Candidates classified as \"other\" significantly decreases, as total Virginia votes reaches yet another all time high! This shows that while the Virginia population grows, people are also more likely to vote, potentially exemplifying the increasing importance of political actions."

    "This figure of total votes for republican and democratic parties over time gives great intell to the change in majority votes. Republican votes and democratic votes both increase in time, but Republican votes don't increase as significantly. In the first election year for which we have data, there is about a 0.2*10^6 difference between democratic voters and the leading republican party. Between the 2004 and 2008 elections, democratic voters took the lead over Republicans and have held it since. This is why Virginia is classified as a swing state - it can be a close call between majority voters. However, there is an increasing desparity between the number of voters for the parties, signifying Virginia's increasing likeliness to become a \"blue\" state."

    "Virginia Beach was the Virginia county which received the least change in democratic voters. Democratic voters increase from 2000-2008, but decrease between 2008-2016. Democratic votes in Virginia Beach were at an all time high for the 2020 election. For this reason, our statistcal analysis predicts an increase in democratic voters, but little change in republican voters for the 2024 presidential election."

    "We predicted the party distribution of voters in the 2024 election for three Virginia counties: Fairfax, Virginia Beach, and Albemarle. This visual shows the total predicted votes from each county, which gives us a prediction as to how Virginia may lean in the upcoming election. About half of the voters are projected to be democrats (51%), with republicans (45%) and green/other parties making up the other half of voters."

    "This project aims to predict the election results in Virginia for 2024, utilizing historical voting data from 2000 to 2020 to analyze trends and make informed projections. We focused on key variables such as 'year,' 'county name,' 'candidate,' 'party,' 'candidate votes,' and 'total votes,' which are crucial for gaining  valuable insights. The analysis revealed a significant shift in Virginia's voter distribution, increasingly favoring the Democratic Party since the 2000 election. This trend, particularly noticeable after the 2008 election, indicated a pivot from predominantly Republican to Democratic votes. Based on these patterns, we predict that Virginia will lean Democratic in the upcoming 2024 election, likely featuring a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Our statistical models suggest a higher likelihood of Virginia voters supporting Joe Biden, potentially designating the state as \"blue\" and contributing 13 electoral votes towards his national tally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis at the county level identified Fairfax in Northern Virginia as having the highest rate of increase in Democratic voters, whereas Virginia Beach in the southeastern coastal region showed the lowest. This geographical variance highlights the strategic importance of localized campaigning, especially in swing states like Virginia, where significant efforts could tip the balance in either direction.Given the historical data and current trends, our recommendation for the Biden campaign is to focus on Southern Virginia, particularly around areas like Virginia Beach, which show a slower rate of Democratic growth. Targeting these regions could maximize campaign impact, possibly swaying the overall state results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to potential criticism or questions of how reputable our project is, we can defend our project with the evidence of our comprehensive data set and usage of a variety of statistical models for our analysis. We've chosen relevant variables for predicting election outcomes and employed both trend analysis and predictive modeling, cross-validating our findings for reliability. We are transparent about the assumptions of our models and provide cautious interpretations of our results. We do acknowledge that there is much work that could be done that is outside of the scope of the project. Analyzing the impacts of social media platforms could significantly enhance the predictive power of your project by gathering data of opinion trends. This approach involves scanning and interpreting the vast amounts of data generated by users on platforms. Doing so could provide strategic advantages in creating campaign messages and strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our project predicts a continued rise in Democratic support among Virginia voters, potentially influencing the state's political alignment in the 2024 presidential election. These projections will be testable against actual voting outcomes in November 2024. "
