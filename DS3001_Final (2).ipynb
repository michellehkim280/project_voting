    "## Summary\n",
    "This project looks to analyze voting patterns in Virginia from historical election data, aiming to uncover patterns and predict future outcomes. By looking into data on voting by candidate and party, with geographical information, we seek to explore voter preferences, election results and predict the outcomes of the 2024 election. In this project, we look to answer the question of how election results in Virginia have changed over time and how results will look in future elections. Our project utilizes numerous datasets and csv files, including county, county adjacencies, and voting in Virginia data. These datasets were cleaned before conducting analysis, which is discussed later in this paper. After cleaning, the variables within the data were analyzed through visualizations. The variables being used in this analysis include county FIP codes, total votes, candidates, and political party. These are key variables that will be the most effective in giving insights about voting in Virginia. With the help of these visualizations, our project then aims to predict the election results of Virginia in 2024. Our projected results show that the Democratic party votes will continue to be the highest, but that the Republican party will also have a substantial amount of votes. "

    "## Data\n",
    "This part of the paper is dedicated to explaining the data and key variables of the analysis, including the data cleaning that was conducted in this project. Data cleaning is an essential first step in data analysis and helped to ensure that our datasets were consistent. Before cleaning, we imported necessary libraries and read in the csv files. Our datasets primarily consist of historical voting data for Virginia. Key variables include, ‘year,’ ‘county name’, ‘candidate’, ‘party’, ‘candidate votes’, and ‘total votes,’ which provide information about electoral trends over the years."

    "Reading the numerous county_data csv files was troubling because we had to conduct the same loading and cleaning for each, and figure out how to save it all to one dataframe. We used a for loop that iterates over our list of files and stores them all in one array. After loading in the multiple csv files, we cleaned them by first standardizing the FIPS codes. This ensures that any column named ‘FIPS’ or ‘county_fips’ contains a string that is 5 characters, giving us consistency across data sets. An always significant challenge with any project involving data is dealing with missing values and outliers that could potentially skew the analysis. For this dataset, we decided to fill in missing values with the median of the column. We went through this strategy to maintain the integrity of the dataset, rather than entirely removing it. Removing entire rows with missing values could result in losing potentially good data and reduce the power of our statistical analysis. Our approach was also similarly done with categorical columns, as we fill in missing values with the most of each column. However, we removed any rows that are missing the FIPS code because it is critical in identifying counties or states. Without the FIPS code, our geographical data would be incomplete. "

    "Before making any predictions, we wanted to first analyze historical data and gain an understanding of voting in Virginia. We began by creating bar graphs displaying the total candidate votes for presidential candidates in the United States from each election in 2000-2020. To create the graphs, we selected only relevant columns from the voting_va dataframe (vdf) and filtered the data frame for the election year, ensuring that the analysis only focuses on that one election cycle. The code then aggregates the total votes for each candidate using ‘groupby’ on the column, ‘candidate’ and then adding up ‘candiddatevotes.’ This gives us the total votes for each candidate that they received in the designated election from Virginia. We used specific colors for different parties, so red for the Republican Party, blue for the Democratic Party, etc. This was to give a visual distinction between candidates and to allow for better comprehension of the graph.  \n",

The graph clearly demonstrates that the vast majority of votes were once again taken by the two major parties: Democrats and Republicans. Barack Obama (Democrat) and John McCain (Republican) received almost all of the votes, with Obama leading significantly in Virginia. Barack Obama’s lead over John McCain is visually significant. This might potentially reflect broader national trends or specific local factors that led more voters towards Obama."
